# TODO

## Respawning after death

## Replacing possible client systems into roact components

- this does not decrease performance because it's only referencing to one entity
- replace things such as movements, cameras
- I'm pretty sure I can put the entire movements systems into the components
- remove stuff like canOpenInventory
